## Hardware Setup
To set up the Wi-Fi password grabber using Raspberry Pi Pico, follow these steps:
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer via USB.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Copy the `payload.dd` file with the Ducky Script code to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
4. Disconnect the Raspberry Pi Pico from your computer.

## Usage
To use the Wi-Fi password grabber:
1. Insert the Raspberry Pi Pico into the target computer's USB port.
2. Wait for approximately 20 seconds to allow the computer to recognize the device.
3. The rubber ducky will automatically execute the Ducky Script code.
4. The Wi-Fi passwords will be sent to the specified webhook.site URL.

Please note that this project is intended for educational and ethical purposes only. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and adhere to applicable laws and regulations before using the Wi-Fi password grabber.

## Customization
You can customize the Ducky Script code in the `payload.dd` file to execute different commands or perform specific actions on the target computer. Modify the PowerShell code according to your requirements, ensuring you understand the potential impact and legal implications of the actions taken.

## Limitations and Considerations
- The Wi-Fi password grabber implementation using Raspberry Pi Pico may vary based on the specific Ducky Script code and the target computer's operating system and configuration.
- Ensure you have appropriate legal authorization to perform any actions on target systems and comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
- Be aware of the potential risks and ethical considerations when executing scripts on unauthorized systems.
- Use this project responsibly and ethically. Do not use it for any illegal activities or malicious purposes.
